"shinyNORRM" is an R package to get an efficient CIPW algorithm and igneous rock classification system written in R and running in shiny... I hope that it proves simple to use.

For simple use
Shiny app:

```{r shiny-app, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("shinyNORRRM")
Ternary::shinyNORRRM()
```
Or if you want the latest development version of the package:

```{R Github package, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
install_github("TheRFrog/shinyNORRRM")
```

Once the package is installed, load it into the current R session with 
```{R Load}
library("shinyNORRRM")
```

There are two stages to creating a ternary plot: first, rendering the plot, styled
as you like it and pointing in any of the four compass directions; secondly, adding data.


## Input a database

At its simplest, all you need to do is type
```{shiny run}
TernaryPlot()
```


## Bugs and feature requests

I hope the package proves useful. If there"s anything it can"t do that you wish
it could, please let me know by opening a
[Github issue](https://github.com/ms609/Ternary/issues/new?title=Suggestion:+).
